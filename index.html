          What is Tallysticks?
          <span>
            <ul>
              <li>A secure and private cost-effective Blockchain-based software solution that facilitates invoice payments and automates invoice reconciliation in a timely manner which ultimately increases profitability.</li>
              <br>
              <li>An immutable recordkeeping framework that establishes a trusted practice, amongst transaction participants as well as permissioned third-parties, for recording when, how and if invoice issuances, payments and reconciliations were performed.</li>
            </ul>
          </span>

        <span class='icon-one floating-icon'></span>
        <div class='discover-more-text text-block-one'>
          <h2>AVOID DUPLICATE INVOICES AND DOUBLE PAYMENTS</h2>
          <p>Between 0.1% to 0.5% of invoice payments are duplicated either through processing errors or duplicate invoice submissions, but Tallysticks can identify process duplications as well as foster a framework of trust between parties, both, ultimately resulting in reduced error-related costs.</p>
        </div>
        <span class='icon-two floating-icon'></span>
        <div class='discover-more-text text-block-two'>
          <h2>GET THE MOST FROM EMPLOYEES BY AUTOMATING LOW-VALUE ACTIVIES</h2>
          <p>Switching from paper-based to electronic invoice processing can reduce invoicing costs by 55% to 65%. Tallysticks delivers an additional savings of approximately 25% to 40% over competing electronic invoice reconciliation software platforms.</p>

          <h2>PREVENT EMPLOYEES FROM STEALING</h2>
          <p>Estimates indicate that employees defraud or steal between 5% and 20% of revenues from their employers. By leveraging Tallysticks’ smart design features, employees are prevented from manipulating data and stealing.</p>

          <h2>ELIMINATE THE INCENTIVE FOR HACKERS TO STEAL DATA</h2>
          <p>Corporations lose approximately 0.8% of revenues as a result of hacked or stolen data. However, Tallysticks’ military-grade data encryption renders stealing sensitive invoice-related payment and other information useless.</p>
