          %h2 AVOID DUPLICATE INVOICES AND DOUBLE PAYMENTS
          %p Between 0.1% to 0.5% of invoice payments are duplicated either through processing errors or duplicate invoice submissions, but Tallysticks can identify process duplications as well as foster a framework of trust between parties, both, ultimately resulting in reduced error-related costs.

          %h2 GET THE MOST FROM EMPLOYEES BY AUTOMATING LOW-VALUE ACTIVIES
          %p Switching from paper-based to electronic invoice processing can reduce invoicing costs by 55% to 65%. Tallysticks delivers an additional savings of approximately 25% to 40% over competing electronic invoice reconciliation software platforms.

      <div id="flip-content1" class="back">
      <h2>WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?</h2>
      <p>Blockchains are stores of immutable historical records.  In fact, the blockchain is considered an excellent technology for credibly recording individual and organisational affairs by a reciprocally convincing process that cannot be refuted by the parties involved in those matters or those permissioned to review them.  As a result, blockchains are ideal for recording transactions or agreements (such as: legal agreements, financial transactions, organisational records, etc…) that may be refuted or queried at a later stage by the parties (themselves), auditors, insurers, investors, regulators, supervisors or even the judiciary/law enforcement.</p>

      <div id="flip-content2" class="back">
      <h2>WHAT IS A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER?</h2>
      Distributed ledgers are publicly shared accounts of all historical blockchain records within a given network.  Because all blockchain records are distributed to all participants in a network, there is a consensus for the records.  Consequently, blockchain records are regarded as immutable since any attempt to alter the records of one ledger would require the simultaneous alteration of all other existing ledgers—a difficult task requiring an inordinately large amount of computing power.  This basic tenet is consensually agreed across the network.

      <div id="flip-content3" class="back">
      <h2>WHAT ARE SMART CONTRACTS?</h2>
      <p>Smart contracts are groupings of code and data residing within the blockchain that are distributed across the network. This renders the blockchain a distributed application and database container, and why we see the blockchain as a next generation software system.  Moreover, because of the attributes of the blockchain and smart contracts, Tallysticks can be universally integrated into existing enterprise technology architectures with minimal operational disruption or training.  It is because of these properties that we feel our technology’s architecture design has great potential within and amongst organisations.</p>

      <div id="flip-content4" class="back">
      <h2>WHAT ARE KEYS?</h2>
      Each blockchain user in a given network is assigned a private key that has an associated public key known by all other network users.  Every time a given blockchain user performs a task in the network (eg. issues an invoice, pays a bill, delivers a shipment, etc…), the key is used to record those actions on the network’s distributed ledger system.  Yet, even though all network participants have a record of all recorded tasks, not every network participant is able to read each record because all information written on the blockchain is encrypted, with only those permissioned public keys (ie. users with the correct associated private key) able to decipher certain data.  So, a distributed ledger system ensures a consensus of immutable (encrypted) blockchain records and the keys manage the permission of who can read various blocks of information on the ledger.  Consequently, as long as each user securely safeguards its private key, blockchain technology will continue to offer users unrivaled data security.
